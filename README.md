# Pygame Physics Simulation

This repository contains a series of experiments and simulations created using **Pygame** and **Pymunk** to explore basic physics concepts like gravity, impulse, collisions, and rigid body dynamics.

## Project Overview

This project includes a 2D physics simulation where various objects interact under gravity. The simulation includes static boundaries, dynamic objects like balls, pendulums, and a custom structure, all handled using **Pymunk**, a Python wrapper for the physics library **Chipmunk**.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Objects**: Add balls and apply impulses with mouse interactions.
- **Dynamic Physics**: Includes pendulums and basic dynamic objects affected by gravity.
- **Boundaries & Structures**: Customizable static boundaries and structures made with boxes and lines.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Runs at 60 frames per second, updating physics states and rendering objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, you need to install the following libraries:
- `pygame`
- `pymunk`

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install pygame pymunk
